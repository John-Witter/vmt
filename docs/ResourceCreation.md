## Introduction

Resources are created in various ways throughout VMT.

For example, creating a resource by clicking the blue "CREATE" button is handled by [NewResource.js](../client/src/Containers/Create/NewResource/NewResource.js). 

The aim of this text is to give guidance on the various ways resources are created and the actions associated with resource creation.
