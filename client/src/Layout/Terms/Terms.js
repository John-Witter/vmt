          <h3>3. Personal Information and Student Data</h3>
          <p className={classes.Description}>
            When 21PSTEM is used by a School for an educational purpose, 21PSTEM
            may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the
            School or by the Student. “Student Data” is personal information
            that is directly related to an identifiable Student and may include
            “educational records” as defined by the Family Educational Rights
            and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g). Confidentiality.
            21PSTEM agrees to treat Student Data as confidential and not to
            share it with third parties other than as described in these Terms,
            and in our Privacy Policy. Student Data Access. You authorize
            21PSTEM to access or collect Student Data for the purpose of
            providing the Service. In the U.S., 21PSTEM shall collect and
            process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate
            educational interest pursuant to FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1). As
            between the parties, the School or the Student owns and controls the
            Student Data. 21PSTEM does not own or control, or license such
            Student Data, except as to provide the Service and as described in
            these Terms. Personal Information and Student Data Consents and
            Authority. If you are School User, you represent and warrant that
            you have provided appropriate disclosures to your School and to
            parents regarding your sharing such Personal Information with
            21PSTEM. Both Parties agree to uphold their obligations under the
            Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), the Protection
            of Pupil Rights Amendment (&quot;PPRA&quot;), and the Children’s
            Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) and applicable State
            laws relating to student data privacy. 21PSTEM relies on each School
            to obtain and provide appropriate consent and disclosures, if
            necessary, for 21PSTEM to collect any Student Data, including the
            collection of Student Data directly from students under 13, as
            permitted under COPPA. You agree to comply with these Terms and all
            laws and regulations governing the protection of personal
            information, including children’s information, and the sharing of
            student education records. Use of Student Data. By submitting or
            providing us access to Student Data, you agree that 21PSTEM may use
            the Student Data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the
            Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing
            our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the
            School’s or the User’s consent. 21PSTEM shall not use Student Data
            to engage in targeted advertising. Any data collected for research
            purposes will be overseen by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”)
            and the collection of your data for approved research purposes will
            be done as required by an IRB, often including User consent (and
            assent from Minors with consent from a guardian). Use of Anonymized
            Student Data. You agree that we may collect and use data derived
            from Student Data for our own purposes, such as for product
            development, research analytics, and marketing our Service, provided
            that such data will be de-identified and/or aggregated to reasonably
            avoid identification of a specific individual. Third-Party Service
            Providers. You acknowledge and agree that 21PSTEM may provide access
            to Student Data to our employees and service providers, which have a
            legitimate need to access such information in order to provide their
            services to us. We and our employees, affiliates, service providers,
            or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of
            Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of
            such data. Student Data Retention and Deletion Requests. Schools may
            request that we delete Student Data in our possession at any time by
            providing such a request in writing, except that 21PSTEM shall not
            be required to delete content a Student shared to public areas of
            the Service. We shall respond to the deletion request as soon as
            possible, but in most instances within 45 days, other than for data
            stored on backup tapes which shall be deleted in the ordinary course
            of business. A Parent seeking to modify, correct, or delete personal
            information in a Student Account that is connected to an active
            School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss
            data deletion or modification. We are not required to delete data
            that has been derived from Student Data so long as it has been
            anonymized such that it does not reasonably identify an individual.
            Data Breach Notification. We have implemented administrative,
            physical and technical safeguards designed to secure Personal
            Information, including Student Data, from unauthorized access,
            disclosure and use. In the event we have a reasonable, good faith
            belief that an unauthorized party has gained access to or been
            disclosed Student Data (a “Security Event”), that we have collected
            or received through the Service, we will promptly notify the School.
            If, due to a Security Event which is caused by the acts or omissions
            of 21PSTEM or its agents, a notification to an individual,
            organization or government agency is required under applicable
            privacy laws, the School shall be responsible for the timing,
            content, and method of any such legally-required notice and
            compliance with such laws and 21PSTEM shall indemnify the School for
            costs related to legally-required notifications. With respect to any
            Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of
            21PSTEM or its agents, 21PSTEM shall reasonably cooperate with
            School’s investigation of the Security Event, as School requests, at
            School’s reasonable expense. 21PSTEM shall be responsible for the
            timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such
            laws as they relate to User accounts that are not associated with a
            School account.

          <p className={classes.Description}>
            Entire Agreement. These Terms and our Privacy Policy, together with
            any additional terms to which you agree when using particular
            elements of the 21PSTEM Services (e.g., terms relating to the
            payment of fees for certain 21PSTEM Services), constitute the entire
            and exclusive and final statement of the agreement between you and
            21PSTEM with respect to the subject matter hereof, and govern your
            use of the 21PSTEM Services, superseding any prior agreements or
            negotiations between you and 21PSTEM with respect to the subject
            matter hereof. Governing Law. These Terms and the relationship
            between you and 21PSTEM will be governed by the laws of the
            Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. All lawsuits arising from or relating
            to these Terms or your use of the 21PSTEM Services will be brought
            in the Federal or State courts located in Pennsylvania and you
            hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of
            such courts for such purpose. Additional Terms. The failure of
            21PSTEM to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms
            will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
            provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent
            jurisdiction to be invalid, you nevertheless agree that the court
            should endeavor to give effect to the intentions of 21PSTEM and you
            as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of
            these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that
            regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause
            of action arising out of or related to use of the 21PSTEM Services
            or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or
            cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in
            these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or
            contractual effect. These Terms will remain in full force and effect
            notwithstanding any termination of your use of the 21PSTEM Services.
            If access to the 21PSTEM Services is licensed to the United States
            government or any agency thereof, then the 21PSTEM Services will be
            deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer

            release, performance, display, or disclosure of the 21PSTEM Services
